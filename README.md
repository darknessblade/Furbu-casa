# Furbu-casa
ESP home furby control [1998] for home-assistant/esphome

Note: I am no coder by any means the 2 listed text files with the YAML code are made with help of AI, 
I have not tested the code yet, and I might revise it depending on what motor-controller I will use myself.

The code is currently only suitable to send motion commands and make the eyes a different color, I plan on adding VOICE support later in the future, where Furbu-casa responds to voice/audio and starts moving.

I do not plan on adding FULL voice support yet, where you can use it as a Voice-controller.
It is possible to do this, but this is outside of what I can do with coding.

Feel free to revise and improve of the code.
